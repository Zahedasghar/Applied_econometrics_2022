## Overview and objectives

This is a comprehensive training with a focus on doing empirical economics with R. It will aim at teaching R for doing economics instead of learning R. Moreover, objective will be to enable research students to do analysis having speed, efficiency and reproducibility so one focus on research question in hand rather spending most of one's time on editing, formating and other trivial things.This is designed to introduce [students to focus on research design]{.yellow}, [thinking clearly with data]{.yellow} and learn by practice. [**Doing Economics**](https://www.core-econ.org/doing-economics/) by CORE exercises in R (pdf/html document generated in R) will be the requirement for research students to get a pass in the course. Emphasis during the eight weeks comprehensive workshop will be

-   Data wrangling, data visualization and data tables

-   Econometric tools with nice printable format

-   Learning Quarto Markdown Language (R/Python/Julia) for producing beuatiful document with files speaking to files without copy and paste

-   Producing macroeconomics graphs like NYT/Economist/WSJ... with effective storytelling

-   Reproducing results [Impact Evaluation in Practice](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/sief-trust-fund/publication/impact-evaluation-in-practice)

## Resources

- [Doing Economics by CORE](https://www.core-econ.org/doing-economics/)
- [R4D](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
-   [Telling Stories with Data](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/)
-   [Applied Economics with R](https://github.com/hhsievertsen/applied_econ_with_r) I will be providing students with several sets of practice questions during the course besides some of the resources mentioned above. \## Course contents

## Data Science

-   [You don’t “learn R”, you learn how to do things in R]{.hi}

-   The next 8 weeks are all about giving you the tools you need

    -   Admittedly, a bit before you know what you need them *for*

-   We will extend them as we learn specific models

## R

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Free** and **open source**

-   A very large community

-   Can handle virtually any data format

-   Makes replication easy

-   Can integrate into documents (with `Quarto markdown`)

-   R is a *language* so it can do *everything*

    -   A good stepping stone to learning other languages like *Python*
