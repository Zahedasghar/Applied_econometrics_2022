## Data Science

-   [You go into data analysis with the tools you know, not the tools you need]{.hi}

-   The next 2-3 weeks are all about giving you the tools you need

    -   Admittedly, a bit before you know what you need them *for*

-   We will extend them as we learn specific models

## R

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Free** and **open source**

-   A very large community

    -   Written by statisticians for statistics
    -   Most packages are written for `R` first

-   Can handle virtually any data format

-   Makes replication easy

-   Can integrate into documents (with `R markdown`)

-   R is a *language* so it can do *everything*

    -   A good stepping stone to learning other languages like *Python*

## Excel (or Stata) Can't Do This

::: panel-tabset
## Code

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ggplot(data = gapminder, 
       aes(x = gdpPercap,
           y = lifeExp,
           color = continent))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
	scale_x_log10(breaks=c(1000,10000, 100000),
	              label=scales::dollar)+
	labs(x = "GDP/Capita",
	     y = "Life Expectancy (Years)")+
  facet_wrap(~continent)+
  guides(color = F)+
  theme_light()
```

## Output

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
ggplot(data = gapminder, 
       aes(x = gdpPercap,
           y = lifeExp,
           color = continent))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
	scale_x_log10(breaks=c(1000,10000, 100000),
	              label=scales::dollar)+
	labs(x = "GDP/Capita",
	     y = "Life Expectancy (Years)")+
  facet_wrap(~continent)+
  guides(color = F)+
  theme_light()
```

## Or This

::: panel-tabset
### Input

The average GDP per capita is `` ` r dollar(mean(gapminder$gdpPercap)) ` `` with a standard deviation of `` ` r dollar(sd(gapminder$gdpPercap)) ` ``.

### Output

The average GDP per capita is `r dollar(mean(gapminder$gdpPercap))` with a standard deviation of `r dollar(sd(gapminder$gdpPercap))`.
